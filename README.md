# BunSane Framework Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **BunSane** - a batteries-included TypeScript API framework built on the Bun runtime.

## üéØ What Makes BunSane Special?

BunSane revolutionizes API development by combining the power of Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with modern TypeScript. Built specifically for Bun's high-performance runtime, it provides a flexible foundation for building scalable applications.

### Key Differentiators

- **ECS Architecture**: Flexible data modeling without traditional ORM limitations
- **Type-Safe Everything**: Full TypeScript integration with compile-time guarantees
- **Bun-Native Performance**: Optimized for Bun's speed and efficiency
- **Component-Based Design**: Build complex entities from reusable components
- **Built-in GraphQL Support**: GraphQL integration with Yoga

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Install BunSane
bun install bunsane

# Create your first entity
import { Entity, Component, CompData, BaseComponent } from 'bunsane';

@Component
class UserProfile extends BaseComponent {
  @CompData()
  name: string = '';

  @CompData()
  email: string = '';
}

// Create and save an entity
const user = Entity.Create();
user.add(UserProfile, { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' });
await user.save();
```

## üìö Core Architecture

BunSane is built around four fundamental concepts:

### 1. **Entities** - Your Data Objects
Entities are the core data containers in BunSane. Unlike traditional objects, entities are composed of multiple components, allowing for flexible and dynamic data structures.

### 2. **Components** - Data Building Blocks
Components are pure data structures that define specific aspects of your entities. They're decorated with `@CompData()` and automatically persisted to PostgreSQL.

### 3. **ArcheTypes** - Entity Templates
ArcheTypes provide reusable templates for creating entities with predefined component sets, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency.

### 4. **Services** - Business Logic
Services contain your business logic and can integrate with GraphQL resolvers for API endpoints.
